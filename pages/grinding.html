                <h1>The fineness of the grind strongly affects brewing</h1>
                <h2>The whole coffee beans are ground, also known as milling, 
                    to facilitate the brewing process.</h2>
            

            <p>
                Brewing methods that expose coffee grounds to heated water for longer require a coarser grind than faster brewing methods. Beans that are too finely ground for the brewing method in which they are used will expose too much surface area to the heated water and produce a bitter, harsh, "over-extracted" taste. At the other extreme, an overly coarse grind will produce weak coffee unless more is used.
                Due to the importance of a grind's fineness, a uniform grind is highly desirable.
            </p>

            <p>
                If a brewing method is used in which the time of exposure of the ground coffee to the heated water is adjustable, then a short brewing time can be used for finely ground coffee. This produces coffee of equal flavor yet uses less ground coffee. A blade grinder does not cause frictional heat buildup in the ground coffee unless used to grind very large amounts as in a commercial operation. 
                A fine grind allows the most efficient extraction but coffee ground too finely will slow down filtration or screening.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ground coffee deteriorates faster than roasted beans because of the greater surface area exposed to oxygen. 
                Many coffee drinkers grind the beans themselves immediately before brewing.
            </p>

                There are four methods of grinding coffee for brewing:
                <li>Burr-grinding</li>
                <li>Chopping</li>
                <li>Pounding</li>
                <li>Roller grinding</li>

            <h2>Burr-grinding</h2>

            <p>
                Burr mills use two revolving abrasive elements, such as wheels or conical grinding elements made of stainless steel or ceramic, between which the coffee beans are crushed or "torn" with little frictional heating.

The process of squeezing and crushing of the beans releases the coffee's oils, which are then more easily extracted during the infusion process with hot water, making the coffee taste richer and smoother.

Both manually and electrically powered mills are available. These mills grind the coffee to a fairly uniform size determined by the separation of the two abrasive surfaces between which the coffee is ground; the uniform grind produces a more even extraction when brewed, without excessively fine particles that clog filters.
            </p>
            <p>
                These mills offer a wide range of grind settings, making them suitable to grind coffee for various brewing systems such as espresso, drip, percolators, French press, and others.
                Many burr grinders, including almost all domestic versions, are unable to achieve the extremely fine grind required for the preparation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_coffee">turkish coffee</a>; traditional Turkish hand grinders are an exception.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://majestycoffee.com/blogs/posts/what-is-a-burr-coffee-grinder">Burr grinders has two types</a> - conical burrs and flat wheel burrs. Most manual coffee grinders use conical burrs, but there have been a number of exceptions recently using flat wheel burrs including ghost burrs and hybrid designs.

                Both of them grind coffee bean consistently and with uniform size. There are also burr grinders, including a few manual coffee grinders, utilizing two burr sets for prebreaking and fine-grinding in order to sieve out coffee chaff, potentially work as slow feeders, achieve more uniform coffee grinds, and, in the case of manual grinders, ease operation or improve through-put.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many electrical burr grinders offer larger hoppers for storing whole coffee beans and are easy to use with a portafilter for espresso grind. 
                Almost every burr coffee grinder grinds with lower noise than with other grinding methods.

            <h2>CHOPPING</h2>
            <p>
                Coffee beans can be chopped by using blades rotating at high speed (20,000 to 30,000 rpm), either in a blade grinder designed specifically for coffee and spices, 
                or in a general use home blender. 
                Devices of this sort are cheaper than burr grinders, but the grind is not uniform and will produce particles of widely varying sizes, while ideally all particles should have the same size, appropriate for the method of brewing. Moreover, the particles get smaller and smaller during the grinding process, which makes it difficult to achieve a consistent grind from batch to batch.

                Blade grinders create "coffee dust" that can clog up sieves in espresso machines and French presses, and are best suited for drip coffee makers. They are not recommended for grinding coffee for use with pump espresso machines.
